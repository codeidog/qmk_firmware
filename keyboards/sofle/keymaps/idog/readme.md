# Personal keymap for Sofle Keyboard rev1


Features: NEED TO UPDATE THIS
- 1 
- 2

NOTES:
- When setting `TAPPING_TERM` in the config.h file is does not allow redefinition and gives a warning (which is treated like an error).  
Until I find a fix the solution is to change it to the required value at `$QMK_HOME/keyboards/sofle/rev1/config.h`
